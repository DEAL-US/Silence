# Must complete (high priority)
- 

# Should be done eventually (medium priority)
- Finish proper CI (actual testing, grab settings from the sample project, cross-builds)
- Compatibility with other databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Support for different user roles

# Would be nice (low priority)
- Automate the command listing and handling
- Filter/sort/paginate by editing the SQL query
- Create a `silence test` command (only in case we're gonna include testing within the project)
