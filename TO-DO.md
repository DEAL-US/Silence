# Must complete (high priority)
- Register/login endpoints and auth control
- Webserver

# Should be done eventually (medium priority)
- Finish proper CI (actual testing, grab settings from the sample project, cross-builds)
- Logging

# Would be nice (low priority)
- Automate the command listing and handling
- Nice log colors
- Gracefully close the DB connection on CTRL+C
- Filter/sort/paginate by editing the SQL query
