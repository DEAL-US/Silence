# 1.2.3-dev
- Changed the serialization of datetime objects to follow ISO 8601.
- Bumped Flask-CORS to 3.0.9.
- Migrated the CI testing from Travis to GitHub Actions.

# 1.2.3
- Set the MIME type of `.js` files to `application/javascript` manually, to prevent the wrong type from being dispatched due to bad configurations of the Windows registry.

# 1.2.2
- Added a new `HTTP_CACHE_TIME` setting to control caching of static web files. Defaults to 0 for easier development, which means that all static files (HTML, JS, CSS...) are not cached by web browsers.
- The list of all loaded endpoints is now displayed when using `silence new`. Added a new `SHOW_ENDPOINT_LIST` setting to disable this behavior.
- The `SECRET_KEY` is now changed in-place when creating a project from a repo URL if it already exists, instead of always adding it in a new line with the info comments.

# 1.2.1
- Added `cryptography` to dependencies for compatibility with MySQL.

# 1.2.0
- Improvements to `silence new`:
    - It now requires a project name, i.e., you cannot use `silence new` without at least one argument.
    - It downloads a certain template by default, right now, 'employees'.
    - A different template can be specified using the `--template` argument.
    - A GitHub repo URL can be provided using the `--url` argument. Note that `--template` and `--url` are mutually exclusive.
    - The `--blank` parameter is provided as a shorthand for `--template blank`.
    - It now removes any `.gitkeep` files found in the downloaded project.
    - If a `SECRET_KEY` is already set for the downloaded project, `silence new` deletes it and provides a new, randomly generated one.
    - A warning is issued if a `settings.py` file cannot be found in the downloaded project.
    - It automatically determines the default branch name for the repository to download, instead of assuming "master" (yes, I'm looking at you, "main").
- A new command, `silence list-templates`, retrieves the list of existing project templates.
- Minor: Vectorized logo shown in README.md.

# 1.1.2
- Set the default address for the webserver to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`

- Fixed 500 errors when simplejson was installed alongside Silence

# 1.1.0
- Added a check for new Silence versions when using `silence run`, and a `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` configuration parameter to opt out of this check
- Add support for storing the endpoint files in a folder named `endpoints/` instead of `api/`. The support for an `api/` folder will be dropped in the future.
- Display a warning message if endpoints are found in the `api/` folder instead of `endpoints/`

# 1.0.7
- Fixed encoding errors that resulted in 500 errors
- The endpoint loader now doesn't try to load non-Python files, which resulted in a fatal error
