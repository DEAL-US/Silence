Silence is a framework that allows for a rapid deployment of a RESTful API and a Web application around a relational database. Silence revolves around the concept of projects, which contain everything needed to deploy the previously mentioned elements and can be moved and/or shared between computers or systems with ease.

Check out [**Silence's wiki page**](https://github.com/DEAL-US/Silence/wiki) to see how to get started and for detailed documentation.

Silence has been built by the [**DEAL research group**](https://deal.us.es/) as an educational and teaching tool for its use in several courses of the Degree in Computer Science at the University of Seville.
